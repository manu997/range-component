# Range Component in Next.js

This project is a technical exercise focused on creating a `<Range />` component with two modes of operation: a normal range slider and a range slider with fixed values. The project is built using **Next.js** 14 and **SCSS** for styling.

## Features

- **Custom Range Component**: Supports both standard range and fixed-value ranges.
- **TypeScript Support**: Provides strong typing throughout the project.
- **SCSS Modules**: Scoped styling for the components to avoid style conflicts.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: One of the components is implemented as a Server Component in Next.js for enhanced performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: Server-side rendering and React framework for building fast web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and improves development efficiency.
- **SCSS Modules**: Used for modular and reusable styling.
- **React**: Component-based library for building user interfaces.
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting tool to ensure code quality and consistency.
